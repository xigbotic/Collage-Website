    <h3>3. How We Use Your Data</h3>
    <p>The data we collect is used to offer the services you request, maintain and improve the bot, and prevent misuse. Specifically, we use your data in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Data:</strong> We use your LastFM username to provide LastFM-related features, like fetching your music data. Your server ID may be used for abuse prevention, and if necessary, for blacklisting a server from using the bot.</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary Data:</strong> The temporary data (user ID, command, and optional data) is necessary for us to process your requests and execute commands properly. After 7 days or once 1,500 lines of data are accumulated, the data is automatically deleted.</li>
