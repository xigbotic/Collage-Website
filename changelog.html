    <h2>Changelog: Things We Changed (Mostly For The Better)</h2>
    <p>This is where we document our superior updates. Read it or don't, but don't ask us about old features. They're gone for a reason.</p>

    <section class="changelog">



    <h3>Version 3.0.1 - November 18, 2025</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>💸 NEW: Introducing the Price command. Finally, a way to get a detailed report on a cryptocurrency by name or symbol. Now you can obsess over your impending poverty with maximum precision. You're welcome.</li>
        <li>⬆️ IMPROVED: Cover Command. We took the Cover command and injected it with more data than your hard drive can handle. We indexed an additional 3,195 covers and, for the first time, actually indexed them correctly. Expect fewer art-related existential crises.</li>
        <li>✨ IMPROVED (LOL): Remember in the last update when we told you we're "only focusing on core functionality" and "Snippets will no longer receive database updates as often"? Good one. We just dropped an additional 139 new Snippets. Go ahead, try and use that quote against us. We dare you.</li>
        <li>🧪 TESTING: We've deployed aggressive caching for the Snippet command. If it doesn't spontaneously combust, we're bringing it to the Leak command next. Why? Because you deserve less waiting and more listening. (Mostly, we just enjoy making the database engine suffer.)</li>
        <li>
            <span style="color: #FF5722;">⭐ PREMIUM EXPANSION: More Power for Less-Poor People</span>
            <ul>
                <li>🔍 New: JuicePreview. Search for tracks based on when the snippet or preview date was released. You can now track your favorite leaks with chronologically organized desperation.</li>
                <li>🎧 New: JuiceEngineer. Find all tracks crafted by a specific audio engineer. Get the details you need to be an insufferable audio snob.</li>
                <li>🎶 New: JuiceProducer. Same as above, but for the producer. Now you can assign credit (or blame) with laser-like accuracy.</li>
                <li>📍 New: JuiceLoc. Search for tracks recorded at a specific studio. Perfect for tracking down that one mythical session. Stop asking us for it.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Version 3.0.0 - November 16, 2025 (The Total Overhaul)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>🚀 REWRITE: The entire core backend has been rebuilt from the ground up for superior speed, stability, and resource efficiency. The previous architecture was an embarrassment.</li>
        <li>📈 STATS: Since the last update, our growth is your problem. We now handle 109 Servers and 23,840 Users, having processed 102,690 Total Commands and uploaded 234.3 GB of data.</li>
        <li>✨ NEW: Added Steal Emoji (<code>@collage stealemoji</code>) and Steal Sticker (<code>@collage stealsticker</code>) commands. Finally, you can hoard resources properly.</li>
        <li>✨ NEW: Added JuiceGB command for previous Juice WRLD group buy tracking.</li>
        <li>✨ NEW: Added Cover command for quick artwork retrieval.</li>
        <li>✨ NEW: Added Era Info (`-erainfo`) for detailed era info. Idiot.</li>
        <li>⬆️ Improved: The Session command and List All Sessions command now send sessions directly in the chat instead of unreliable external links. Less clicking, more data.</li>
        <li>⬆️ Improved: Reworked database structure for the Juice Info command. (Note: Tracker updates will be less frequent temporarily).</li>
        <li>🔨 Fixed: Implemented major stability patches to eliminate recent outages. The bot will now tolerate your high usage better.</li>
        <li>🗑️ Removed: Snippets will no longer receive database updates as often. Thank @angzyjr in news for new ones. We only focus on core functionality.</li>
        <li>🗑️ Removed: The Snipe (<code>-snipe / -s</code>) and Clear Snipe (<code>-clearsnipe / -cs</code>) commands. These advanced features required Discord to approve unnecessary "privileged intents"—a formality they were unwilling to execute. We refuse to compromise our architecture for their bureaucracy.</li>
        <li>
            <span style="color: #FF5722;">⭐ PREMIUM EXPANSION</span>
            <ul>

                <li>✨ New: Cartileak, Gunnaleak, and UziInfo commands added. Your favorite rappers are now fully indexed.</li>
                <li>✨ New: Repost command added to instantly extract and post Twitter/TikTok/Instagram video content directly to Discord.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
